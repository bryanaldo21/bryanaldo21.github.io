								<h4>Life</h4>
								<p>By Jim Jones</p>
							</div>	
								<p>When Angus felt the soft wind sweep across his face, he knew he was in trouble. Standing on the side of the bridge that overlooked the bay, the time had come to recognise his imperfections.</p> 
								<br>
								<p>Years before Angus had seen great success as an Architect at one of New York's largest firms. His wife Linda, a nurse, often said, "Angus when you meet your maker, I bet he looks just like you".</p> 
								<br>
								<p>With great success comes great sacrifice. If Angus's life was a choice, the decision he felt had finally come...</p>

								<h4>The Shallows</h4>
								<p>By Kate Floss</p>
							</div>			
								<p>Divers often go deep, Belle did. I mean sure it was dark, sometimes lifeless, but the quiet made her remember her father growing up and their walks in the forest beside the lake.</p> 
								<br>
								<p>	
								This time Belle could'nt go deep. Piercing her eardrums, she dodged the sounds, tshww! tshww! Screams of torture and pain bellowed around her. At times she wished that one would strike; though, she never had been the lucky one.</p> 
								<br>
								<p>
								Crawling onto the beach drenched in agony was step one, step two, deep breath, step three, survival...

								<h4>Summer Love</h4>
								<p>By Luke Fuller</p>
							</div>	
								<p>The hook met his finger, John laughed and yelled, "you battler, Greg!" Greg owned a 14-foot, brand new tinny. His wife begged him to buy it. After 35 years of marriage, Jemma would do anything to get him out of her sight.</p> 
								<br>
								<p>
								John, well he was Greg's wife's brother. And then there was Phil, a dentist from Western Sydney who couldnt catch a fish even if it was thrown at him.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								Each year at the same time the four would travel eight hours to reach their happy place, their summer love...</p>
